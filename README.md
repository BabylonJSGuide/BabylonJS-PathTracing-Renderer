# BabylonJS - PathTracing Renderer
#### When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit.

## Getting Started

We use [parcelJS](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) as a compiler and you just have to do

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

and then go to https://localhost:1234 to see the result.

## Contribution
